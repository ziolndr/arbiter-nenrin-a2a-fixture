Freshness v3 (nenrin-time-v3): multi-source beacon, and forged vs unverifiable split

v2 closed backdating with a beacon and made currency fail-closed. Two seams stayed open in
v2, and the cross-build with the founding witness made both concrete, so the operator closes
them on its own harness rather than only naming them to someone else. v3 cites v2 and
supersedes its beacon check. It does not edit v2. A correction is a new file that cites the
old, the manifest rule applied to the operator, not an exception carved for it.

  Seam 1, single source. v2 checked the beacon against one source. A single explorer going
  dark, or lying, decided the not-before bound alone. The rule under everything is the same:
  the coordinate must come from a source the prover does not own, and one source the prover
  does not own is still one point of failure. v3 checks the beacon against several
  independent sources and requires a quorum of agreement before it AFFIRMS. One reachable
  source below quorum cannot vouch for a proof, because a lone source you cannot cross-check
  is trusted, not verified.

  Seam 2, forged vs unverifiable. v2 put two different things in one bucket. A height that
  provably does not exist on the chain, and a height that cannot be checked right now because
  the explorer is down, rate limiting, or blocking, both came back not-authentic, and both
  refused the proof. That punishes an honest prover for an outage. v3 separates them:
    - a structurally impossible height is a bad coordinate. Fail closed, always, even if
      other sources are down. A provable lie does not become truer because a second source
      is unreachable.
    - a height no reachable source can affirm, and none structurally reject, is unverifiable
      now. The honest prover is not branded a forger and the proof is not refused. But the
      not-before bound is not established, so it is not asserted not-backdated and not
      current. Named, retryable, never folded into valid.

Correction v3.1, pre-anchor, found by the founding witness's review (recorded in the addendum
with the superseded sha). v3 coupled the backdating check to the quorum, so a backdated proof
carrying a real block passed as indeterminate whenever only one source was reachable.
Reproduced on the old bytes, then decoupled: corroboration (beacon_authentic) still needs a
quorum to affirm; the backdating check (not_backdated) runs against ANY confirmed read, even
a lone one, because a single independently fetched source is real data. One honest witness is
enough to refuse, corroboration is required to vouch. Residual named: a lone corrupt source
can cause a false refusal, a recoverable fail-closed error exposed when the others return.

v3.2, the tip made explicit (prompted by the witness porting the tip discriminator live and
asking whether v3 carries the near-tip residual):

  Seam 3, the veto, now derived from data rather than a fixture flag. Each source reports its
  own tip. A height is STRUCTURALLY impossible, and vetoes, only if it is malformed (negative,
  not an integer) or beyond the HIGHEST tip among all reachable sources plus a margin of
  MARGIN_BLOCKS (6, Bitcoin's own confirmation depth). It is compared against the highest
  reachable tip, not against each source's own tip, on purpose: a source lagging more than the
  margin behind the chain would otherwise veto a real block that another source has already
  confirmed. One source's tip is never the whole set's tip. A height a source lacks, whether
  just above that source's tip (lag) or in a gap below it (fault), is evidence about that
  source and not about the chain, and never vetoes; it degrades that source to cannot-confirm.

  The near-tip residual, carried and bounded. Inside the margin, a fabricated height with a
  random hash and an honest block that no source has indexed yet look identical: both are
  unverifiable_now. Nothing can break that tie at that moment, because nothing can confirm a
  block that does not exist yet. What breaks it is the chain advancing. When the height is
  actually mined, every honest source returns the real hash: the fabricated claim mismatches
  and flips to forged, refused; the honest claim matches and flips to authentic. The unknown
  bucket is a waiting room that empties in the direction the truth points, within the
  confirmation depth. A forgery can never be vouched for in the meantime, because no honest
  source will ever match a random hash, so quorum stays structurally unreachable for it.
  advance_chain() models the chain moving so the convergence is tested, not asserted.

  Residual named: with only one reachable tip, "beyond every reachable tip" rests on that one
  source; a stale lone source can cause a false refusal of a real far-ahead block. Recoverable,
  exposed when the others return. Same class as the v3.1 residual.

v3.3, the tip itself gets a quorum (prompted by the witness's reviewer probing the v3.2 fix
and finding that a compromised sibling can suppress a legitimate reject):

  The residual on the highest tip. Comparing against the highest reachable tip closed the
  liveness hole, and opened this one: a compromised or MITM'd source can inflate its own
  reported tip to cover a ghost height, and the honest sources' structural reject downgrades
  to unverifiable. The liar cannot reach authentic, because quorum still needs the real hash
  at two sources and a wrong hash loses to any mismatch. But refusing a fabricated height is
  the point of the veto, and one liar could switch it off. Reproduced on the v3.2 bytes.

  Why three sources change the shape. At two sources there is no third value between the
  highest and lowest tip, so you choose which single fault to tolerate: compare against the
  highest tip and a liar can suppress a reject; compare against the lowest and a stale source
  can veto a real block. That is the witness's irreducible two-source residual, and he named
  it rather than engineering it away, correctly. At three sources the choice dissolves. The
  reference tip is the QUORUM-th highest reachable tip, the highest height that at least a
  quorum of sources vouch for. A single liar inflating its tip becomes the highest and is
  ignored. A single stale source becomes the lowest and is ignored. One fault of either kind
  cannot move it. It is the same one rule applied to the tip itself: the coordinate must come
  from a quorum the prover does not own, and a tip reported by one source is one source.

  Degraded mode, named. With exactly QUORUM sources reachable there is no slack, so the
  reference tip falls back to the highest and the two-source residual returns for that call:
  a liar can suppress a reject, a stale source cannot veto. Disclosed as tip_basis. With more
  than one fault (two stale sources of three, or two liars) the single-fault model is out of
  scope; two stale sources can cause a recoverable false refusal of a fresh block, two liars
  can reach authentic, and neither is claimed closed.

  Not changed on purpose: any mismatch still fails closed. Two honest matches could outvote
  one wrong hash under the same quorum logic, but a contradiction between sources is evidence
  in itself, and refusing exposes the liar where averaging would hide it. That is a design
  choice, held open for the witness rather than decided alone.

Fail closed on the adversary, fail open on the outage, refuse on one honest witness, vouch
only on corroboration, and let the chain settle what no source can. Real Ed25519,
deterministic, offline. A live version reads two or more block explorers (mempool.space and
blockstream.info share the block-height and tip-height request shapes) or, stronger, a
locally synced header set that needs no third-party API at all.
