# NENRIN witness state record 0001: the founding witness's corresponding state (`nenrin-witness-state-0001`)

Kind: witness state record, anchored beside JIDEC entry 24 (NENRIN coordinate-v1 addendum, time axis v3.3).
Witness: Federico Blanco Sanchez-Llanos, the founding witness named in NENRIN discrepancy record 0001 (entry 20) and in the coordinate-v1 addendum (entry 24).
Submitted by the witness to the operator over direct message on 2026-09-03 (22:45 JST), recorded here unchanged.

Cited, anchored, unchanged:

## The witness's statement

Commit id, given by the witness as the current head of the freshness file in his own verifier:

    63fac98cdff2e4bc4985778b65d730d7a419e4d8

Described by the witness as: the round four fix (every source fetches its own numeric tip on every call; quorum tip is the second highest reading; a height_proven fallback lifts a sibling's veto but never counts toward a match; authenticity requires every source to match, full unanimity) plus the shared codebase disclosure written next to his source list, nothing since.

The witness states that this commit is his side's state corresponding to entry 24, and that both sides read the same count over the operator's harness: three reviews, one defect, two residuals.

## Why this is recorded

Two verifiers were built apart and cross-checked each other on bytes, not on words. The operator's state is fixed by entry 24. Until now the witness's corresponding state existed only in a message. Anchoring the commit id fixes the pairing in time: whatever that commit contains, it was named as the corresponding state at or before the anchored block.

## What this record proves, and what it does not

It proves that this commit id was named by the witness as his corresponding state, and that the operator recorded it unchanged, at or before the time this record entered a Bitcoin block.

It does not prove the contents of the commit, which live in the witness's repository and not here. It does not prove that either implementation is correct, or that the two are equivalent. It does not prove the witness's repository is public, or will stay so. A commit id names bytes; it does not deliver them. Whoever holds the repository can show that the bytes match the id, and nobody, including the operator, can change which id was named.

## Limits both sides have named, carried forward

Two of the witness's three live sources run the same explorer codebase. Operator independence is what the quorum buys; implementation independence it does not. Named in his source, named here, not fixed. The operator's own third source, a locally synced header set, is modeled and not yet wired live, so the operator claims no more on that axis than the witness does.

Corroboration from outside the quorum, an anchor or a second protocol, is evidence of a different kind and not a vote. Recorded on both sides; built on neither yet.

The choice of how many sources must agree before a proof is called authentic is a choice of which single fault to tolerate, an outage or a collusion, and every rule between two of three and full unanimity sits on that one line. The witness chose unanimity. The operator's choice is recorded in the addendum that cites entry 24, not here.
