"""Mutation test for agreement_redteam.py. It breaks agreement_verify.py one rule at a time and
checks that the adversary notices. Run: python3 agreement_mutation.py   (about ten minutes)

A suite of 178 vectors that all pass proves nothing on its own: a suite can be green because
the rules hold, or green because the vectors never touch them. This file tells the two apart.
It was worth writing twice. First it found that the single most important rule in the whole
program, that a verdict is never "accepted" unless both signatures actually verified, could be
replaced with the constant true and the adversary stayed green. That is now vector-covered, and
the flag is derived from the evidence in the report rather than set beside it. Then, before asking
an outside reviewer to find a surviving mutant, the operator hunted for one first: eleven
candidates outside this list, ten of which survived. Every rule they broke existed in the
verifier; what was missing was a vector. All ten are in the list below now. A suite that catches
every mutant somebody wrote for it has said nothing about the mutants nobody wrote, and the only
way to learn the difference is to keep writing new ones.

Two mutants are expected to SURVIVE and are marked so. A mutant that changes no behaviour is not
a hole in the adversary, and pretending otherwise would train the reader to ignore this output.

Where it does the breaking took three tries to get right, and the story is worth keeping because
each version failed in a way the previous one could not see.

First version: mutate agreement_verify.py in place, restore in a finally block. The claim was
"restored on every exit path, including a crash and a Ctrl-C". True for exceptions and for SIGINT,
false for SIGTERM: python ends the process without running finally. On 2026-09-10 a two minute
command timeout sent exactly that signal mid run and left a mutant in agreement_verify.py.

Second version: keep mutating in place, but write a backup beside the file first and remove it
only after a byte for byte restore. A run that dies leaves the backup, and the next run restores
from it. That held for the case it was built for, and then broke on the case it was not: later the
same day the backup could not be deleted (the folder allowed reading and writing but not unlink),
so it survived a successful run, and the NEXT run treated it as evidence of a crash and restored
a stale copy over a legitimate edit, silently deleting it. A recovery mechanism that fires when
nothing is wrong is worse than none, because it destroys work while reporting health.

Third version, this one: **do not touch the file at all.** Copy the verifier, the signer and the
adversary into a temporary directory and mutate the copy. Then SIGTERM, SIGKILL, a full disk and a
folder that forbids unlink are all the same event: the working tree was never modified, so there
is nothing to restore and nothing to leave behind. The check at the end is not "did the restore
work" but "is the real file byte for byte what it was before this program started", which is a
question that can be answered without trusting anything this program did.

If a backup from the second version is still lying around, this program says so and stops. It does
NOT restore from it. Deciding what a leftover file means is a person's job; the failure above is
what happens when a program decides that for itself.
