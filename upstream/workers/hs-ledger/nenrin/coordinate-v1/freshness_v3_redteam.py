Freshness v3 red team. Attack the seams v3 closes: the single-source beacon, the collapse of
forged into unverifiable, the coupling of the backdating check to the quorum (v3.1), and the
tip-derived veto with its near-tip residual (v3.2). Real Ed25519, offline, deterministic.
The rule being enforced: fail closed on the adversary, fail open on the outage, refuse on
one honest witness, vouch only on corroboration, and let the chain settle what no source can.

Attacks:
  1  forged_height_during_outage      malformed height, other sources down -> fail closed.
  2  sources_disagree                 two sources affirm different values -> forged, fail closed.
  3  lone_source_below_quorum         one source reachable, honest -> unverifiable, not authentic.
  4  backdated_below_beacon           created_at before an authentic quorum beacon -> fail closed.
  5  postdated_future                 created_at after the forward anchor -> fail closed.
  6  tamper_beacon_in_content         beacon swapped after signing -> id_integrity breaks.
  7  backdated_lone_source   (v3.1)   backdated, one confirming source -> REFUSED. the defect the
                                      founding witness found; on the v3 bytes this passed.
  8  beyond_all_tips_refused (v3.2)   height past the highest reachable tip plus margin -> structural,
                                      refused, even though no source can index it.
  9  margin_boundary_exact   (v3.2)   tip+6 is lag (unverifiable, not refused); tip+7 is structural
                                      (refused). the boundary pinned, same depth the witness chose.
 10  stale_source_no_veto    (v3.2)   one source ten blocks behind lacks a real block that two others
                                      confirm -> authentic. under a per-source tip rule that stale
                                      source would veto a corroborated block. it must not.
 11  stale_source_lone_confirm (v3.2) one source ten behind, one down, one confirming -> unverifiable,
                                      NOT refused. a stale source must not turn one honest read into
                                      a refusal.
 12  forged_near_tip_converges (v3.2) fabricated height inside the margin: before the chain arrives,
                                      unverifiable (the residual, shown not hidden); after the chain
                                      indexes the real block, forged and refused. the waiting room
                                      empties toward refusal.
 13  honest_fresh_converges  (v3.2)   an honest unindexed block: unverifiable before, authentic after.
                                      the same waiting room empties toward affirmation.
 14  liar_tip_refused_at_three (v3.3) one source inflates its tip to cover a ghost height while two
                                      honest sources say lag -> still REFUSED. the quorum tip ignores
                                      the single highest. on the v3.2 bytes this passed as unverifiable:
                                      the residual the witness's reviewer found.
 15  liar_tip_at_two_named   (v3.3)   the same liar with only two sources reachable -> unverifiable,
                                      never authentic, tip_basis max_degraded and the residual disclosed.
                                      the two-source shape, named not hidden.
 16  liar_match_never_authentic (v3.3) a liar claims ok_match at a ghost height with a fake hash ->
                                      one match is below quorum, unverifiable; and where an honest
                                      source holds the real block, the fake hash is a mismatch, forged.
                                      a single liar buys unknown at most, never authentic.
 17  two_stale_named         (v3.3)   two of three sources ten behind, one fresh confirms -> refused.
                                      a false refusal, outside the single-fault model, pinned so the
                                      limit is visible rather than discovered.

Controls (must PASS):
  c1  honest_all_up                   quorum met, in window, fresh -> valid and current.
  c2  outage_tolerated                one source down, quorum still met -> authentic, valid.
  c3  outage_not_punished             all sources down, honest -> unverifiable, refused False,
                                      time_indeterminate True, current False.
  c4  window_disclosed                creation window, per-source map, highest tip, margin on record.
  c5  gap_source_no_veto              a source with a gap below its tip (fault) -> cannot-confirm,
                                      never a veto.
