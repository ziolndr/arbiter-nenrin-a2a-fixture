"""a2a_conduct_walk.py : reference client for the A2A Conduct Extension v1 witness walk.

Walks one agent the way section 4 of CONDUCT_EXT_v1.md says, writes a jidec-path-v1 record
with a witness field, prints its sha256, and (with --submit) files it at the witness intake
the agent's own card points to. Standard library only, Python 3.8 or later.

    python3 a2a_conduct_walk.py --origin https://mcp.horizonshield.dev \\
        --witness-name "your name or anonymous" --vantage "your network or tool" \\
        [--endpoint https://mcp.horizonshield.dev/mcp] [--mode mcp|a2a] [--wire 1.0|0.3] [--out walk.json] [--submit]

What it asserts (each one pinned by sha256 of the bytes it turned on):
    card_bytes_stable           two fetches of the agent card, seconds apart, are the same bytes
    conduct_ext_declared        the card lists the extension URI under capabilities.extensions[]
    compensation_well_formed    params.compensation has the shape section 2 requires
    measured_endpoint_answered  the measured endpoint answered a JSON-RPC request with a result of the
                                shape the wire version requires (1.0: {task}|{message}; 0.3: kind).
                                Recorded n/a, not FAIL, when the endpoint answers 402: see below
    payment_required_as_declared  an endpoint that answers 402 declares a paid model on its card
    extension_echoed            (a2a mode only) the response header A2A-Extensions carries the URI, or
                                X-A2A-Extensions when the walk used the 0.3 wire (that is the spelling
                                a 0.3 client sends and reads: the official SDKs' compatibility paths)

What it does not do: it does not judge quality, it does not read the conduct record for you,
and a PASS is not a verdict about the agent. It is one observation, filed where anyone can
read it and count it. Canonical bytes: keys sorted at every level, separators , and : with no
spaces, non-ASCII unescaped. sha256 of those bytes is the record's identity.

conduct-v1.3 draft (2026-09-11, ops/conduct_v1_3_paid_endpoint_20260911.md). Two changes, both found
by walking a real agent that charges for calls, and both invisible to 47 green vectors because every
fixture agent was free and every fixture card declared the extension.
    402 is an answer, not a silence. Before this, every status that was not 200 fell into one bucket,
    so an agent behaving exactly as its own card says was recorded the same as a broken one.
    measured_endpoint_answered is now n/a on 402 and payment_required_as_declared says what happened.
    A walk NEVER pays: a witness that pays the agent it walks has the relationship this layer exists
    to disclose. That is also why the undeclared case is a FAIL, so 402 cannot become a way to stop
    being measured.
    compensation_well_formed no longer answers a question about the extension. With no extension it
    is asked of the card's top-level compensation key (which the gate's condition 3 has read since
    0.2.0) and the record says which declaration it read; with no declaration anywhere it is n/a.
    Whether the extension is declared is conduct_ext_declared's whole job and is not restated.

conduct-v1.1 (2026-09-07, ops/conduct_v1_1_draft_20260907.md). Every record this client writes now
carries `mode`, `establishes` and `does_not_establish`; the last one is the field that keeps a reader
from taking a PASS for a verdict, and the intake refuses a v1.1 record without it.
    --privacy full        (default) urls, methods and body hashes of every node, as before
    --privacy hash-only   node urls are reduced to the origin, methods to REDACTED, request hashes dropped;
                          the record says which tool was called nowhere
    --privacy commitment  only sha256(canonical full record || salt) is filed; the full record and the salt
                          stay on your disk (walk_<sha12>.json, walk_<sha12>.salt) until you choose to reveal
    --key FILE --key-url URL   sign the record (Ed25519, needs the `cryptography` package) with a key you also
                          serve at URL as {"public_key_ed25519_b64": ...}; the ledger then records the domain
                          of URL as your identity (signed_domain). --print-public-key FILE prints that JSON.
    --vantage-limitation "text"   what you could not see from where you stood (a proxy, a cache, a region)
