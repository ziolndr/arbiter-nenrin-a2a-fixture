"""Emit the shared fixture a second implementation of the verifier must reproduce.

Why this file exists (2026-09-10).

The agreement record has one verifier, in Python, with 185 vectors and 74 mutants
behind it. The next step people keep asking for is an intake: somewhere to POST a
record and have it checked. An intake lives in a Worker, a Worker is JavaScript,
and writing the rules a second time in a second language is how two
implementations that disagree get born. Disagreement between implementations is
the exact seam the NENRIN work measures. Building it into this layer on purpose
would be a poor joke.

The ring builder faced the same fork and took the same road: a shared fixture
first, then a second implementation, then byte for byte agreement proved on that
fixture before anything was published (ledger entry 34). This file is that first
step for the agreement layer.

What it does: it wraps agreement_verify.verify, runs the adversary, and records
every call that the 185 vectors actually make, with the exact input and the exact
report. The result is a JSON file whose canonical bytes have a sha256. That sha
is the contract. A second implementation is correct when it turns every input in
that file into the byte identical report beside it, and not before.

What it refuses to do: it will not write a fixture from a red adversary run. A
fixture emitted while a vector is failing would freeze the failure as the
specification, and every later implementation would be proved to agree with a
defect. The adversary must be all green or nothing is written.

What it cannot capture, said here rather than left to be found: an input the
adversary builds that JSON cannot hold. A record that refers to itself, a float
that is NaN or infinite. Those vectors still run and still count in the
adversary; they simply cannot travel to another language through a JSON file, so
they are listed by name under "skipped" with the reason, and a second
implementation is untested on them. Anyone reading a coverage claim about the
second implementation should read that list first.

Usage:
  python3 agreement_fixture.py                    write agreement_vectors_v1.json
  python3 agreement_fixture.py --out other.json   write somewhere else
  python3 agreement_fixture.py --selftest         run the built in cases

    This file is transport. Escaping everything to ASCII means a lone surrogate,
    which is legal JSON text and illegal UTF-8, can still travel to another
    language as \ud800 and arrive as the same string.

    The first version of this file used ensure_ascii=False and threw away 187
    vectors as "not carryable", every one of them a lone surrogate case. The lone
    surrogate is the defect that crashed this verifier on 2026-09-10 and got a
    guard written for it. Dropping exactly that class from the fixture would have
    left the second implementation untested on the one input we already know
