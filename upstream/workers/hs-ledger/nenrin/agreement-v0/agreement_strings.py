"""The wording the verifier emits, pulled out of the fixture so a second implementation can read it.

Why this file exists (2026-09-10).

A second implementation of the verifier has to reproduce 708 English templates,
about 65,000 characters, byte for byte. Retyping that into JavaScript would make
every typo look like a disagreement between implementations, and it is not one.
The thing worth proving is that both sides reach the same DECISION: which refusal
code fires, which template applies, what gets interpolated. The wording is data.

So the wording is lifted out as data. Not out of agreement_verify.py, which stays
untouched: out of agreement_vectors_v1.json, which already holds every report the
185 vectors produce. Deriving it costs the verifier nothing and leaves the
contract sha where it is.

The danger in a derived table is the one this repository met twice today: a value
that lives in two places gets changed in one. So this file carries --check, which
rebuilds the table from the current fixture and fails when the committed table
disagrees. A table nobody re-derives is a table that is quietly wrong.

What this table is NOT: it is not the specification. agreement_verify.py is. This
is a view of what that file says, taken through the adversary, and it therefore
holds exactly the wording the adversary causes and no other. A branch no vector
reaches contributes no string here, and a second implementation reading this table
has nothing to emit on that branch. That limit is the same one the fixture
already states, and it belongs beside any claim of agreement.

Usage:
  python3 agreement_strings.py            write agreement_strings_v1.json
  python3 agreement_strings.py --check    exit 1 if the written table is stale
  python3 agreement_strings.py --selftest run the built in cases
