"""Offline verifier for agreement records.

Two schemas, one program.

  a2a-agreement-v1     the draft anchored as JIDEC entry 39 (ops/AGREEMENT_EXT_v0_DRAFT.md).
                       Read exactly as written. Its holes are named, not silently repaired,
                       because the draft's sha is anchored and quotable.
  a2a-agreement-v1.1   ops/AGREEMENT_EXT_v0_1_DRAFT.md. Every hole found while building this
                       verifier, closed. Strict by construction: the record carries its own
                       public keys, so it verifies offline forever, and every string, number,
                       size and shape in it is bounded.

What a record says: at time T, party A and party B both signed the same bytes describing terms,
and each pointed at a conduct record, by sha256, about the other. This program judges the SHAPE
and the SIGNATURES. It never judges the terms, and there is no editorial step anywhere in it.

What it deliberately does not do
  No network. It does not fetch key_url, the agent cards, the conduct records, or a ledger.
  Under v1.1 the keys are inside the signed bytes, so nothing needs fetching to verify. Under
  v1 the keys are supplied locally with --keys. Reachability is the intake's problem (503,
  retry), not a verifier's.

Fail closed
  The verdict is never "accepted" unless an Ed25519 verification actually ran and passed for
  both parties. A verifier that says accepted without that launders a one sided record into a
  two sided claim. The report always carries signatures_checked and key_urls_checked, and the
  establishes list changes with them: what a record proves is not the same question as whether
  it was refused.

Usage
  python3 agreement_verify.py RECORD.json [--keys keys.json] [--recorder-domain D] [--now ISO]
  python3 agreement_verify.py --example        # a v1.1 template
  python3 agreement_verify.py --example-v1     # the v1 template

  keys.json maps key_url to the Ed25519 public key served there:
    {"https://party-a.example/keys/agreement.json": {"public_key_ed25519_b64": "..."}}
  A bare string value is accepted too.

Exit codes: 0 accepted, 1 refused, 2 incomplete (shape passed, signatures not checked).
